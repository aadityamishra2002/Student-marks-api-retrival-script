Python Project: Student Marks Analysis with API, Averages, and Bar Chart
This project retrieves student data from an API, calculates average marks, and visualizes the results using a bar chart.

Features:

Fetches student information (including marks) from a specified API endpoint.
Parses the API response (assuming JSON format).
Calculates the average mark for all students.
Creates a bar chart displaying student names and their corresponding average marks.

Requirements:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
requests library: Install using pip install requests (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
matplotlib library: Install using pip install matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
Usage:

Clone this repository or download the script ( student_marks_analysis.py ).
Install the required libraries (requests and matplotlib).
Configure the script:
Edit the script (student_marks_analysis.py) and update the following variables:
API_URL: Replace with the actual URL of the API endpoint that provides student data. The data should include a "name" field and a "marks" field (or similar) for each student.
OUTPUT_FILENAME: Replace with the desired filename for the generated bar chart image (e.g., "student_marks.png").
Run the script:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using python student_marks_analysis.py.
Example:

API_URL = "https://api.example.com/students"
OUTPUT_FILENAME = "student_marks.png"

python student_marks_analysis.py
This will fetch student data from the specified API_URL, calculate average marks, and generate a bar chart saved as student_marks.png.

Note:

This script assumes the API response is in JSON format and contains the necessary student information. Modifications might be required for other data formats.
Error handling is not included in this basic example. You may want to add error handling for potential issues like invalid URLs or API errors.
Further Development:

Implement error handling for network issues or invalid API responses.
Allow for user input of the API URL and output filename at runtime.
Modify the script to handle different student data structures or additional fields.
Customize the bar chart appearance (colors, labels, etc.) using Matplotlib functionalities.
This is a basic example to get you started. Feel free to modify and enhance the script to fit your specific needs and API data format.
